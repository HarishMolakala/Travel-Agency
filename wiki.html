        <p>Located in Eastern England on River Cam, Cambridge houses the globally recognized University of Cambridge. Out of all the places in England that are visited by people, Cambridge gives just too many options to choose from when it comes to pleasing the vacationers.

            It is a city that has a lot of parks and other open spaces suitable for outdoor activities like walking, cycling etc. 
            
            Primarily known for the University of Cambridge, this city is known to have the largest number of conserved monumental structures making it one of the most popular places to visit in England especially by architecture students and enthusiasts.
            
            When in Cambridge one can submerge themselves in the magnificent greenery of the Botanic Gardens, take university tours, the list of which by the way is endless in this city of academia, feed their internal bibliophile at one of the many libraries found in the city or simply drown in admiration for the exquisite architecture of various structures sheltered by the city of Cambridge.
            
            Cambridge has a gentle summer during June to August and a chilly, wet winter during December and February. May to August is the pinnacle travel time.

        <p>The London Eye, or the Millennium Wheel, is a cantilevered observation wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames in London. It is Europe's tallest cantilevered observation wheel,[14] and the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom with over three million visitors annually.[15] It has made many appearances in popular culture.

            The structure is 135 metres (443 ft) tall and the wheel has a diameter of 120 metres (394 ft). When it opened to the public in 2000 it was the world's tallest Ferris wheel. Its height was surpassed by the 140 metres (459 ft) Sun of Moscow in 2022, the 160 metres (525 ft) Star of Nanchang in 2006, the 165 metres (541 ft) Singapore Flyer in 2008, the 167 metres (548 ft) High Roller (Las Vegas) in 2014, and the 250 metres (820 ft) Ain Dubai in 2021. Supported by an A-frame on one side only, unlike these taller examples, the Eye is described by its operators as "the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel".[16] The Eye offered the highest public viewing point in London until it was superseded by the 245-metre-high (804 ft) observation deck on the 72nd floor of The Shard in early 2013.[17][18][19]
            
            The London Eye adjoins the western end of Jubilee Gardens (previously the site of the former Dome of Discovery), on the South Bank of the River Thames between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge beside County Hall, in the London Borough of Lambeth. The nearest tube station is Waterloo.

            The Tower of London, officially His Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress of the Tower of London, is a historic castle on the north bank of the River Thames in central London, England. It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, which is separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It was founded toward the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new Norman ruling class. The castle was also used as a prison from 1100 (Ranulf Flambard) until 1952 (Kray twins),[3] although that was not its primary purpose. A grand palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence. As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat. There were several phases of expansion, mainly under kings Richard I, Henry III, and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries. The general layout established by the late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site.
