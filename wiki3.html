            <p>One of the oldest civilisations in the world, India is a mosaic of multicultural experiences. With a rich heritage and myriad attractions, the country is among the most popular tourist destinations in the world. It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity.

        <p>Built by Mughal emperor Akbar in 1565 AD, Agra Fort is a majestic sandstone built as an ode to the magnificence of the Mughal empire. Encompassing within its 2.5-km-long enclosure walls a stunning imperial city, the fortress is shaped like a crescent, its eastern wall flanked by River Yamuna. It is said that the construction of the fort was originally begun by emperor Akbar, but completed by his grandson Shah Jahan, who added most of the marble monuments here. There were originally four gates for entrance, two of which were walled up and only one is open today – the Amar Singh gate. The first thing that captures one's attention as they enter is Jehangir (Jahangir) Mahal, a palace said to have been built by Akbar as the women’s quarters and named after his son, Jehangir (Jahangir). Simple and elegant, it is home to a large stone bowl upon which are carved Persian verses. Local lore holds that this bowl once contained rose water. Adjacent to Jehangir (Jahangir) Mahal lies the palace built for Jodha Bai, said to be Akbar’s favourite queen.

            From idlis (steamed rice cakes) to dosa (crepe-like pancakes), sambar (spicy lentil stew) to rasam (world’s oldest consommé), food of South India is a culture that has developed on the principle of Ayurveda. One of many firsts, steaming as a culinary technique evolved here, and that is how the steamed idlis and pithas (rice cakes) were conceived. In addition, it was here that deep frying technique was mastered and the first fried chicken dish made. The adoption of the Jewish food culture and that of Mappila community also took place here for the first time in the country. Udupi cuisine also developed in this region, which boasts 60 per cent of the Indian vegetarian menu, organic coffee and the best of spices, especially pepper, clove and cardamom. In fact, much of the food that is served here today can be dated back to before 2 century BC. Many believe that the technique of preparation has hardly changed. The Sadya, a ceremonial formal feast, is one such example, which consists of about 28 dishes, including boiled red rice, pickles, sweets, savouries and side dishes. It is served on a plantain leaf and traditionally, the tapering end of the leaf faces the guest.
