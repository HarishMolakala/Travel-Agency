            <p>Lahore (/ləˈhɔːr/ lə-HOR; Punjabi: لہور [ˈlɔ̀ːɾə̆]; Urdu: لاہور [laːˈɦɔːɾ] (listen)) is the second largest city in Pakistan after Karachi and 26th largest in the world, with a population of over 13 million. It is situated in the north-east of the country with River Ravi flowing north-west of the city. It is the capital of the province of Punjab, where it is the largest city. Lahore is one of Pakistan's major industrial and economic hubs.[11][12] It has been the historic capital and cultural centre of the wider Punjab region,[13][14][15] and is one of Pakistan's most socially liberal,[16] progressive,[17] and cosmopolitan cities.[18]

                Lahore's origins reach into antiquity. The city has been inhabited for at least two millennia, although it rose to prominence in the 10th century

        <p>Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni captured Lahore somewhere in 1020–1027. Under Ghaznavid rule, Lahore emerged effectively as the empire's second capital.[46] In 1021, Sultan Mahmud appointed Malik Ayaz to the Throne of Lahore—a governorship of the Ghaznavid Empire. The city was captured by Nialtigin, the rebellious Muslim Governor of Multan, in 1034, although his forces were expelled by Malik Ayaz in 1036.[52]

            With the support of Sultan Ibrahim Ghaznavi, Malik Ayaz rebuilt and repopulated the city, which had been devastated after the Ghaznavid invasion. Ayaz erected city walls and a masonry fort built in 1037–1040 on the ruins of the previous one,[53] which had been demolished during the Ghaznavid invasion. A confederation of Hindu princes then unsuccessfully laid siege to Lahore in 1043–44 during Ayaz' rule.[46] The city became a cultural and academic centre, renowned for poetry under Ayaz' reign.[54][55]
            
            Lahore was formally made the eastern capital of the Ghaznavid empire in 1152,[21] under the reign of Khusrau Shah.[56] The city then became the sole capital of the Ghaznavid empire in 1163 after the fall of Ghazni.[57] Under their patronage, poets and scholars from Kashgar, Bukhara, Samarkand, Baghdad, Nishapur, Amol and Ghazni congregated in Lahore.[58] The entire city of Lahore during the medieval Ghaznavid era was probably located west of the modern Shah Alami Bazaar and north of the Bhatti Gate.

            Minar-e-Pakistan (Urdu: مینارِ پاکستان, literally "Tower of Pakistan") is a tower located in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan.[1] The tower was built between 1960 and 1968 on the site where the All-India Muslim League passed the Lahore Resolution (which was later called the Pakistan Resolution) on 23 March 1940 - the first official call for a separate and independent homeland for the Muslims of British India, as espoused by the two-nation theory. The resolution eventually helped lead to the creation of Pakistan in 1947.[2][3]

            The tower is located in the middle of an urban park, called the Greater Iqbal Park.
