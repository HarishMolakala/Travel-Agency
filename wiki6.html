            <p>Italy (Italian: Italia [iˈtaːlja] (listen)), officially the Italian Republic[a][12][13] or the Republic of Italy,[14][15] is a country in Southern[16][17][18] and Western[19][note 1] Europe. Located in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, it consists of a peninsula delimited by the Alps and surrounded by several islands.[20] Italy shares land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino. It has a territorial exclave in Switzerland, Campione, and some islands in the African Plate. Italy covers an area of 301,230 km2 (116,310 sq mi), with a population of about 60 million;[21] it is the third-most populous member state of the European Union, the sixth-most populous country in Europe, and the tenth-largest country in the continent by land area. Its capital and largest city is Rome.

        <p>Nestled in the heart of Tuscany, Florence is a city that exudes elegance and artistic grandeur. From the magnificent Duomo and the iconic Ponte Vecchio to the world-famous Uffizi Gallery, every corner of Florence is a feast for the eyes and a testament to the Renaissance period. It is also home to celebrated museums, historic markets and magnificent gardens.     For easy sightseeing: An easy walk from the Uffizi and Ponte Vecchio, five-star NH Collection Firenze Porta Rossa is a good central choice for sightseeing. But if you want to wake up to views of the Arno choose a riverside room at Pontevecchio Relais in the heart of Florence.
            For family holidays: Family-run Hotel Nizza might be two-star but it doesn't feel like a budget choice. All rooms are cosy, well-furnished and en-suite. The staff are helpful and its central Santa Maria Novella location makes for easy city.

        <p>Tuscany is famous for beautiful hill towns but few are quite as stunning as San Gimignano. Here a dramatic skyline of medieval towers gazes out over the gorgeous, rolling Tuscan countryside. Strolling through its cobbled streets, visitors are transported back in time, surrounded by ancient architecture and the charming Tuscan countryside.

            Discover the town's historic centre with its winding backstreets and honey-coloured buildings, as well as frescoed churches and grand gothic palazzi.

            The idea of Tuscany as an idyll of olive groves, vineyards, hill towns and frescoed churches may be clichéd, but it is largely true. Late medieval Tuscany was the birthplace of Italian culture and in many ways remains the essence of what travellers imagine Italy to be.

Ask a sample of middle-class Northern Europeans to define their idea of paradise and the odds are that a hefty percentage will come up with something that sounds a lot like Chianti. Life in Chianti seems in perfect balance: the landscape is a softly varied terrain of hills and valleys; the climate for most of the year is sunny; and on top of all this there’s the wine, the one Italian vintage that’s familiar to just about everyone.
