            <p>Qatar has been ruled as a hereditary monarchy by the House of Thani since Mohammed bin Thani signed a treaty with the British in 1868 that recognised its separate status. Following Ottoman rule, Qatar became a British protectorate in 1916, and gained independence in 1971. The current emir is Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who holds nearly all executive and legislative authority under the Constitution of Qatar, as well as controlling the judiciary.[17] He appoints the prime minister and cabinet. The partially-elected Consultative Assembly can block legislation and has a limited ability to dismiss ministers.

                In early 2017, the total population of Qatar was 2.6 million, with 313,000 of them Qatari citizens and 2.3 million expatriates.[18] Its official religion is Islam

            A four-hour trip takes you to the village of Zekreet, where you can see the mushroom-shaped rocks of the Mushroom Hills and the remains of the Zekreet Fort. You will also visit the archaeological site of Ras Abrouq and the sculptures of artist Richard Serra. The shorter two-hour trip introduces you to the Qatar Amphitheatre, the Opera House, the Qatar Plaza shopping centre, the Qatar Mosque and fast food on the streets of Doha. The tour can be attended by anyone between 2 and 69 years old. Enjoy an adventure in the desert on a quad bike and take time for some pictures. An adrenaline-fuelled quad bike ride is a unique experience in the desert, and it is hard to imagine Qatar without it. The ride is not suitable for people with medical conditions.
