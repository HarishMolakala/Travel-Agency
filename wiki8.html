            <p>Peru is most famous for the Inca culture that was prevalent between the 1400s and 1500s. You’ll see their influence all over the country, but mostly in Cusco and the Andean regions. If you have the time, there are many archaeological sites to visit that give you a glimpse into the past, and we talk about some of the most important ones below.

                The country is also known for the Spanish influence and across the cities you’ll see some fantastic architecture, especially in the city centers. We’ve got a few suggestions of some spots to check out so you get to see the biggest variety as possible.

        <p>Without doubt, Machu Picchu is the most famous place in Peru and the one attraction that we’re sure almost every visitor to the country visits. It’s one of the New Seven Wonders of the World and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

            The majestic Inca citadel looks absolutely stunning, sitting up high on the mountain side surrounded by greenery and over the Urubamba River. It’s no wonder the Incas chose this spot as it’s just incredible.
            
            You’ll need to get to the city of Cusco first and then make your way to the archaeological site, which you can do by trekking, or by car and train. You’ll definitely need to book ahead during the busy months, especially if you want to hike the extra mountain of Huayna Picchu as it sells out months in advance

        <p>This is known as one of the best treks in the whole world, and was recognised so by National Geographic. The Classic Trek is 4 days long and takes you to Machu Picchu where you enter through the Sun Gate (Inti Punku). This is the only route that allows you to enjoy the sunset upon entering through this way.

            The trail offers exciting stops at different archaeological sites along the way as well as the fact that you walk along the same route that the Incas themselves once did. You can’t get much more exhilarating than that!
            
            The trek books out months in advance, so you need to plan well if you want to walk along it. There are only a certain number of spots per day. You also need to reserve through an agency and can’t go alone. You need a special permit to access the trail.

            If you’re in Cusco, one of the places you absolutely must see is the Sacred Valley. When you visit and observe the luscious landscape and rolling hills with the river running through the middle, you’ll understand why it got its name.

The Incas were excellent agriculturists and the valley gave them a great source for growing all kinds of crops and having constant access to water. There are some fantastic archaeological sites in the area to visit, including Pisac, Huchuy Qosqo, and Ollantaytambo.

You can enjoy a day trip to some of the sites or stay in the valley itself and take your time visiting all the different locations. There are some wonderful spas to relax in and spend a few days at to escape the city and get out in the country
