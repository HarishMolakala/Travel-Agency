            Christchurch is a vivacious city in traditions that is striving hard to cope up creatively with the aftermath of the New Zealand’s second worst natural disaster. Regarded as the most English of all the New Zealand’s city, the heritage heart of Christchurch was just hollowed out post the earthquakes that occurred in 2010 and 2011 leaving some 186 people dead. Today the scenario has changed.

            At present, Christchurch boats of more repurposed shipping containers and road cones than you’ll find anywhere else in the world. You will find heavy traffic jam, noise and of course the dust but you just don’t have to be deterred. The city’s City Centre is embellished with the beautiful Hagley Park and an equally beautiful Botanic Gardens along with several notable art institutions for you to marvel at. The inner city streets veil pocket gardens and art projects, fringed around a thinned out cityscape which features both remnant stone buildings and the glistening architecture of the new.
